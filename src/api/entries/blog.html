  <h1>Blog Ready</h1>
  <p>
    My blog is ready to publish! So let's start with the first article. Here are some details of the implementation.
  </p>
  <h3>The design</h3>
  <p>
    In <a href="https://decemberlabs.com/">December Labs</a> we have an outstanding design team, most of our projects
    reach the hands of the developer already looking very good. When I have to start a project for myself and I don't
    have any design, I like to create a basic layout before opening the IDE, it always ends up speeding the development
    process. For this web app I created a basic <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a> design:
  </p>
  <div class="article_element">
    <div class="article_image">
      <img alt="" src="https://www.manueme.com/images/manuemeFigma.png" />
      <div class="article_image_footer">
        <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/W6SRBX8bdNLMjLdIaGZO4pa4/manueme"
          >https://www.figma.com/file/W6SRBX8bdNLMjLdIaGZO4pa4/manueme</a
        >
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3>Technology</h3>
  <p><a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a></p>
  <h3>Entries</h3>
  <p>
    The plan for the blog is to publish one or two articles per month, so for this first version, it is not necessary to
    prepare any backend service. The blog data will be stored on a JSON simulating an API, each entry of the array will
    have the meta tag information and a reference to a local HTML file with the article content, here is an example:
  </p>
  <pre class="article_code">
    [<br />
        {<br />
          "article": "test"<br />
          "title": "Test",<br />
          "imgSrc": "https://www.manueme.com/images/Grid.png",<br />
          "brief": "This is a test entry",<br />
          "imgAlt": "",<br />
          "date": "2019/09/01",<br />
          "author": "Manuel Machado",<br />
          "keywords": "Angular",<br />
          "htmlPath": "test.html",<br />
          "description": "Hello world"<br />
        }<br />
    ]</pre>
  <h3>The code</h3>

    The code is public for you to copy, improve, share:
