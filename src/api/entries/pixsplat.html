  <h1>Pixsplat</h1>
  <p>
    The game development introduced me to the programming world, I had to learn how to code to at least understand how
    games were created. However, it seems that I did not choose the simplest development area to take my first steps in
    this world, I quickly realized that it was not only necessary developer skills but also needed to be an artist.

  <p>
    In most of my projects when drawing and animating I ended up iterating with multiple drawing and animation programs
    looking for something I would never find, a program that can do the work for myself while I do what I can do right,
    coding.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the search for the perfect software was not in vain and I noticed three interesting things:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The most known options seemed too complex and expensive for me to draw low-resolution images.</li>
    <li>
      Most of the pixel art-oriented programs were lack of features requiring in most cases other programs to do some
      final tweaks to the job.
    </li>
    <li>
      The options that did not have any of the previous problems were not cross-platform or were web-based with not a
      very good performance.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>What if I develop a drawing and animation program?</h3>
  <p>
    Pixsplat started as a program with the features that I would use for my games, but the project has evolved. The main
    goal is to cover the basic needs of an artist to work with pixel art, but it is also intended to provide some
    capabilities of more advanced image editors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pixsplat is written in C++ with wxWidgets, OpenGL and FreeImage for the UI, rendering the document canvas, and
    handling images respectively.
  </p>
  <h2>Main Features</h2>
  <h3>Windows and Linux (GTK3)</h3>
  <p>
    Pixsplat is being developed in Windows and Linux so it has alphas for both operating systems.

  <h2>When is Pixsplat going to be available to download?</h2>
  <p>
    Pixsplat is on an advanced stage and soon I’ll publish a free beta. Although is important to consider that this is a
    complex project and I’m taking my time to work on it, not only to ensure quality but to enjoy the process.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please contact me if you want to know more about Pixsplat, I’ll be glad to chat about it and answer any questions.
